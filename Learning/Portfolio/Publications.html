            <h2> Interactive Image Projective Desktop and Screen Using Hand Tracking by Leap Motion</h2>
            <p> 	Introduced a cost-effective method for transforming non-touch displays into interactive screens using Leap Motion technology,
                    replacing the expensive laser range finders used previously. The study details the calibration and integration process for both projective and regular monitors,
                    with promising user feedback indicating the system's effectiveness and intuitive use.</p>

            <h2> Hand Tracking in 3D Space using MediaPipe and PnP Method for Intuitive Control of Virtual Globe</h2>
            <p> 	This paper presents a method for controlling virtual globes and maps with hand gestures using Google MediaPipe and OpenCV's PnP.
                    Implemented in a web browser with Cesium, the system enhances interaction by tracking hand movements through a laptop webcam.
                    Results demonstrate its accuracy and robustness, with potential educational applications and recognition from the Toycathon 2021 competition.</p>
